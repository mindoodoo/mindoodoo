# Hi there, I'm Leon ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **21 year old** computer science student currently studying at **Epitech Berlin.**

I am very passionate about **low level systems** programming languages, especially **C** and **Rust**. Over the course of my studies, I have on numerous occasions honed my skills by **re-writing linux cli programs** and **libc functions**. Some of my **favourites** were [Nm / Objdump](https://github.com/mindoodoo/Nm-Objdump), [Ftp Server](https://github.com/mindoodoo/Ftp-Server) and [Malloc.](https://github.com/mindoodoo/Malloc)

Before starting my studies I was mostly interested in **high level** programming languages such as **Python** and **Lua**, working on a **diverse set of projects** ranging from **basic machine learning** using [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) to **android applications** using **lua and corona sdk** (now Solar2D).
