# Hi there, I'm Leon ðŸ‘‹

## tl;dr

I'm a **23 years old** computer science student currently studying at **Epitech Berlin.** French & American, I love everything **technology** and **programming.**

Lately, I've been spending more time writing **rust** in personal projects and **getting more into open source.** I also recently finished working on my master thesis project **Autogrower** which I hope to be able to open source some parts of soon. Autogrower was a consumer oriented hydroponics hardware solution aimed at making hydroponics more accessible to new users. Within the Autogrower team I took on the role of **Project Lead** while also being the **sole developper of the hardware and PCB prototypes.** In my capacity of project lead I oversaw the development of our user applcations, both mobile and web based, the development of the backend, as well as the development of he firmware in which I was more involved due to my in depth knowledge of our circuis design.

**I am currently looking for a software development internship,** feel free to reach out.

## About Me

I am very passionate about **low level systems** programming languages, especially **C** and **Rust**. Over the course of my studies, I have on numerous occasions honed my skills by **re-writing linux cli programs** and **libc functions**. Some of my **favourites** were [Nm / Objdump](https://github.com/mindoodoo/Nm-Objdump), [Ftp Server](https://github.com/mindoodoo/Ftp-Server) and [Malloc.](https://github.com/mindoodoo/Malloc)

When I'm not writing C, you will most likely find me writing **C++.** Some of my favourie projects include :

- :video_game: [a multiplayer sidescroller shoot'em'up client and server](https://github.com/Epitech-R-Type/R-Type)
- :bomb: [a 3D local multiplayer bomberman](https://github.com/mindoodoo/Indie-Studio)
- :game_die: [a set of arcade games supporting graphical library switching at runtime](https://github.com/mindoodoo/Arcade)


Before starting my studies I was mostly interested in **high level** programming languages such as **Python** and **Lua**, working on a **diverse set of projects** ranging from **basic machine learning** using [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) to **android applications** using **lua and corona sdk** (now Solar2D).
