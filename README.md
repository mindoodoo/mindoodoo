# Hi there, I'm Leon ðŸ‘‹

## tl;dr

I'm a **21 year old** computer science student currently studying at **Epitech Berlin.** French & American, I love everything **technology** and **programming.**

Lately, I've been spending more time writing **rust** in personal projects and **getting more into open source.** I'm also working on [**glados**](https://github.com/nLatt/GLaDOS-2023), a **minimalistic** scheme interpreter in **Haskell.**

**I am currently looking for a software development internship,** feel free to reach out.
You may find my resume here : ([English](./LeonSautour-EnglishResume.pdf "download") or [French](./LeonSautour-FrenchResume.pdf)).

## About Me

I am very passionate about **low level systems** programming languages, especially **C** and **Rust**. Over the course of my studies, I have on numerous occasions honed my skills by **re-writing linux cli programs** and **libc functions**. Some of my **favourites** were [Nm / Objdump](https://github.com/mindoodoo/Nm-Objdump), [Ftp Server](https://github.com/mindoodoo/Ftp-Server) and [Malloc.](https://github.com/mindoodoo/Malloc)

When I'm not writing C, you will most likely find me writing **C++.** Some of my best projects include :

- [a multiplayer sidescroller shoot'em'up client and server](https://github.com/Epitech-R-Type/R-Type)
- [a 3D local multiplayer bomberman](https://github.com/mindoodoo/Indie-Studio)
- [a set of arcade games **supporting graphical library switching at runtime](https://github.com/mindoodoo/Arcade)


Before starting my studies I was mostly interested in **high level** programming languages such as **Python** and **Lua**, working on a **diverse set of projects** ranging from **basic machine learning** using [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) to **android applications** using **lua and corona sdk** (now Solar2D).
